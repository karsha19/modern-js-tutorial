# The Modern JavaScript Tutorial

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/portfolio-demo-green)](https://p2635.github.io/modern-js-tutorial/)

This course documents my work for the open source course '[The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)' created by Ilya Kantor.

- The demo badge is a html page that I created to test out my scripts, feel free to try it out.
- The `scripts` folder contains the JavaScript code that I wrote throughout the course.
- The `tasks` folder contains my written assignments. For example, 'Guess the output' questions.
- If later tasks shows my competency in earlier tasks, I generally left out earlier tasks from this repo to keep things simple. There's no point showing what I can do twice.
