# The Modern JavaScript Tutorial

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/portfolio-demo-green)](https://p2635.github.io/modern-js-tutorial/)

This course documents my work for the open source course '[The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)' created by Ilya Kantor.

- The demo badge is a html page that I created to test out my scripts, feel free to try it out.
- The `scripts` folder contains the JavaScript code that I wrote throughout the course.
- The `tasks` folder contains my written assignments. For example, 'Guess the output' questions.
- If later tasks shows my competency in earlier tasks, I generally left out earlier tasks from this repo to keep things simple. There's no point showing what I can do twice.
- Minimum estimated effort required: 174 hours
  - A unit is what I call part of a chapter (1.1... 1.3).
  - There are 174 units (based on getting a count of the element `list-sub__title`).
  - It takes me at least one hour per unit.

# Log
- (24/01/2023) I have completed 22 units over 4 days since I started. This is me fully focusing 7 hours a day on it, so that is about 7 (hours) x 4 (days) = 28 hours. I can roughly estimate 1 hour per unit as my average pace. There are 64 units left for me to do on Part 1, that means it will take me about 64 hours (64 / 7 = ~9 days).
