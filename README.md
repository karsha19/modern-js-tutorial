# The Modern JavaScript Tutorial

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/portfolio-demo-green)](https://p2635.github.io/modern-js-tutorial/)

This course documents my work for the open source course '[The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)' created by Ilya Kantor.

- The demo badge is a html page that I created to test out my scripts, feel free to try it out.
- The `scripts` folder contains the JavaScript code that I wrote throughout the course.
- The `tasks` folder contains my written assignments. For example, 'Guess the output' questions.
- If later tasks shows my competency in earlier tasks, I generally left out earlier tasks from this repo to keep things simple. There's no point showing what I can do twice.
- Minimum estimated effort required: 174 hours
  - A unit is what I call part of a chapter (1.1... 1.3).
  - There are 174 units (based on getting a count of the element `list-sub__title`).
  - It takes me at least one hour per unit.

- [x] Type Conversions
- [x] Basic operators, maths
- [x] Comparisons
- [x] Conditional branching: if, '?'
- [x] Logical operators
- [x] Nullish coalescing operator '??'
- [x] Loops: while and for

# Part 2: Browser: Document, Events, Interfaces

Learning how to manage the browser page: add elements, manipulate their size and position, dynamically create interfaces and interact with the visitor.

TBC.

# Part 3: Additional articles

List of extra topics that assume you've covered the first two parts of tutorial. There is no clear hierarchy here, you can read articles in the order you want.

TBC.

# My Lessons Learned

1. Learned to omit generated TOC headings from Markdown: https://markdown-all-in-one.github.io/docs/guide/table-of-contents.html#hiding-headings-from-toc
2. Multi-cursor (CMD + Option + Up/Down): https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_multiple-selections-multicursor
3. A parameter is the term used 'declare time'. An argument is the term used 'call time' (the value passed).
4. Beginner style guide cheatsheet: https://javascript.info/coding-style
5. Learn the ways of the ninja so you don't have to be one.
6. Quote from comments lesson: "An important sign of a good developer is comments: their presence and even their absence."

# Learning Log

- (24/01/2023) I have completed 22 units over 4 days since I started. This is me fully focusing 7 hours a day on it, so that is about 7 (hours) x 4 (days) = 28 hours. I can roughly estimate 1 hour per unit as my average pace. There are 64 units left for me to do on Part 1, that means it will take me about 64 hours (64 / 7 = ~9 days).
