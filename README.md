# The Modern JavaScript Tutorial

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/portfolio-demo-green)](https://p2635.github.io/modern-js-tutorial/)

This repo documents my work while reading and working through https://javascript.info/.

- The demo badge is a html page that I created to test out my scripts, feel free to try it out.
- Refer to WrittenAssignments.md for non-executable tasks. For example, 'Guess the output' questions.
- There's no point showing what I can do twice. If later tasks shows my competency in earlier tasks, I generally left out earlier tasks from this repo to keep things simple.
